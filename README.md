# Formula-1-Data-Analysis
Analyzed various datasets of drivers, teams, and tracks to discover trends over past seasons. Visualized races with mechanical failures, crashes, and individual driver performances. Implemented machine learning models to predict points of drivers and teams in future seasons.


As a long time Formula 1 fan, I wanted to further my knowledge of the sport by analyzing data from the 2021 season. 
I wanted to take a look at how the points differed from drivers on a race by race basis and highlight the differences in driver lap times on select tracks. 
Additionally, I wanted to examine how the seasons/races are influenced on the mechanical failures of the vehicles. 

This is all done through google colab. I have linked the data files in the folder f1pro.
